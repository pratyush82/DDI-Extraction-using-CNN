# DDI-Extraction-using-CNN
A CNN based DDI Extraction using Python3 in the Jupyter Notebook IDE.
The training and testing dataset files are train_dataset.csv and test_dataset.csv respectively.
The DDI_CNN.ipynb contains the code.
The embeddings used in the code are the glove embeddings. Be sure to download the right file matching the vector dimensions. The file used in the code is the 'glove.6B.100d.txt' file. These are available to download here : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Note : The ZeroDivisionError might occur because the number of 'int' labels are very very less compared to the other labels.
